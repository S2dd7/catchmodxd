1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Ah look, you've won yet another episode.||Congratulations!#But, oh no! how unexpected!||I've spun the wheel and it doesn't look like|you're taking home a prize this time...
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;You know, NONE of you contestants have|won your heart's desire yet.||What a baffling stretch of bad luck!||Anyway, it's time for one more|unlucky spin of the wheel...#Oooof, how unfortunate!||Probably next time though, right? Right!
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;You must think you've been doing SO|well at all this fighting.||So sure, stick with it!||Let's spin the wheel yet again!#Ah, how tragic.||You lose again.
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Well, I've got to give you one thing:|you're persistent.||Still thinking about your heart's desire?||Focused on that win?||Then let's set the wheel spinning!#And now let's STOP the wheel on, look|at that, another unfortunate loss...
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Ah look, here we are at the wheel again!||Let's give it a spin and see...||...whether this time, THIS time, you|might win your heart's desire.#Nope! Oh well, I'm sure things will look|up for you eventually.
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Such a persistent little dice friend!||Sure, let's give the wheel a spin, why not!#No amazing prize this time, I'm afraid.||Bad luck. Maybe it's time to just|give up for ever?
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Here to give it another whirl?||Yeah, absolutely!||This could DEFINITELY be the time that|you win your heart's desire!#Oooh, look at that!||What are the chances?
1;MummyEpisodeWin;normal;Honestly, what would you even DO with|your heart's desire, if you won it?||No, no, sorry, silly question, let's just|get on with the wheel...#Anyway it looks like you don't need to make|any big decisions about what you would do.||At least not just yet.||Maybe next time!
